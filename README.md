# Music Database

--Purpose-- <br>
This is the second of two assignments that allow you to execute query languages of the relational model. Like the first assignment, Module 3: WinRDBI Algebra , this assignment for Module 4 will use the Music Agency Enterprise.  To complete this assignment, you will focus specifically on queries in SQL.

--Instructions-- <br>
Using the Music Agency Enterprise, you are to: 

Load the music2.rdb file in WinRDBI. This data file is located in the folder for the assignment on Canvas. The test data has been modified. You must use the updated version of the rdb file for this assignment. 
Develop SQL solutions for the five queries specified in this assignment WinRDBI SQL Assignment.docx You may breakdown SQL queries into subqueries, if needed. However, your SQL solution must NOT be a translation of a relational algebra or TRC solution. You are strongly encouraged to look at the example queries provided to you on the WinRDBI web pages. Comment the queries and use descriptive table and attribute names.  
When you are finished with the work, upload a PDF files that includes:
Your Name
A snapshot of the complete query file (.sql file) in WinRDBI tool.
A snapshot of the final result data for each query in WinRDBI tool. Do not include all intermediate tables â€“ only include the last table that answers each query. Make sure the result query relation name is included in the snapshot.  
Upload an electronic copy of your query file (.sql file).
